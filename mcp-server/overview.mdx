# MCP 0G Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for interacting with the 0G Galileo testnet blockchain. This server enables AI assistants like Claude to interact directly with the 0G blockchain network.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that allows AI assistants to connect to external systems and services. The 0G MCP server implements this protocol to provide blockchain functionality to AI models.

## 0G Chain Information

- **Network**: 0G Galileo testnet
- **Chain ID**: 16601
- **RPC URL**: https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai
- **Native Token**: OG
- **Block Explorer**: https://chainscan-galileo.0g.ai
- **Faucet**: https://faucet.0g.ai

## Key Features

### Blockchain Queries
- Get chain information and network status
- Query blocks and transactions
- Check OG token balances
- Get current gas prices and estimate transaction costs
- Call smart contracts (read-only operations)
- Query event logs and transaction history
- Access faucet information for testnet tokens

### Wallet Management
- Create new wallets with secure encryption
- Import wallets from private keys or seed phrases
- HD wallet support (BIP44) for multiple addresses
- Secure encrypted storage with password protection
- Export wallet information (public data only)

### Transaction Management
- Preview transactions with gas estimation
- Transaction approval workflows with security policies
- Batch transaction support for efficiency
- Transaction simulation before sending
- Track transaction status and confirmations
- Replace transactions (speed up or cancel)

### Token Management
- Complete ERC-20 token support (transfer, approve, allowance)
- Token metadata discovery and validation
- Portfolio tracking with analytics and insights
- Token security policies and risk assessment
- Token watchlist and discovery features

### Smart Contract Deployment
- Compile Solidity contracts from source code
- Deploy contracts with constructor arguments
- Estimate deployment costs before executing
- Verify deployed contracts match source code
- Track deployment history across networks

## Architecture

The MCP server is built with:

- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **ethers.js v6**: Blockchain interaction library
- **Zod**: Input validation and schema enforcement
- **Node.js crypto**: Secure wallet encryption
- **MCP Protocol**: Standard AI assistant integration

## Use Cases

### AI-Powered Blockchain Interaction
- Natural language blockchain queries
- Automated transaction management
- Smart contract interaction through conversation
- Portfolio monitoring and analysis

### Development Tools
- Contract deployment and verification
- Transaction debugging and simulation
- Wallet management for development
- Testnet token acquisition

### DeFi Operations
- Token transfers and approvals
- Portfolio tracking and analytics
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Risk assessment and security policies

## Security Features

- **Encrypted Storage**: Wallets stored with AES-256-CBC encryption
- **Approval Workflows**: Require approval for sensitive operations
- **Daily Limits**: Set maximum daily transaction amounts
- **Whitelisting**: Auto-approve transactions to trusted addresses
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with helpful suggestions
