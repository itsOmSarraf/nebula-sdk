## 📈 **Expected Test Results**

When you run the tests, you should see:

```
AgentFactory - Comprehensive Tests
  Deployment
    ✓ Should deploy factory successfully
    ✓ Should deploy implementation and token factories
  Agent Deployment
    ✓ Should deploy agent successfully
    ✓ Should deploy agent with initial funding
    ✓ Should fail with insufficient fee
    ... (all tests pass)

AgentImplementation - Core Functionality Tests
  Initialization and Basic Info
    ✓ Should initialize agent correctly
    ✓ Should have correct roles assigned
  Funding - Anyone Can Fund Agent
    ✓ Should allow anyone to fund agent directly
    ... (all core functionality verified)

Token Factories - ERC20 and ERC721
  ERC20 Token Factory
    ✓ Should create ERC20 token successfully
    ... (token creation verified)

  XX passing (Xm Xs)
```

## 💡 **Key Test Insights**

### **What the Tests Prove**
1. **Functionality**: All requested features work correctly
2. **Security**: Access controls prevent unauthorized actions
3. **Efficiency**: Proxy pattern delivers gas savings
4. **Reliability**: Error handling works as expected
5. **Scalability**: Factory can handle multiple agents efficiently

### **Critical Test Scenarios**
- Spending exactly 33% vs 33.1% of balance
- 24-hour time advancement for limit reset
- Multiple users funding the same agent
- Admin withdrawing while agent has spending limits
- Token deployment with correct admin assignment

## 🔧 **Test Infrastructure**

The tests use the latest Hardhat testing patterns:
- **ethers v6** for contract interaction
- **Chai expectations** for assertions
- **Hardhat Network Helpers** for time manipulation
- **LoadFixture pattern** for efficient test setup
- **Event verification** for complete validation

## 📝 **Test Maintenance**

These tests are designed to:
