# Usage

The ElizaOS 0G plugin provides natural language interface for file storage operations on the 0G network.

## Basic Integration

Import and register the plugin in your ElizaOS agent:

```javascript
import { zgPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-0g";

// Register the plugin with your ElizaOS agent
const agent = new Agent({
  plugins: [zgPlugin],
  // ... other agent configuration
});
```

## Natural Language Commands

The plugin responds to natural language commands for file operations:

### Upload Commands

Users can trigger file uploads using various natural language patterns:

```text
"Upload my document.pdf"
"Store this image.png on 0G"
"Save my resume.docx to Zero Gravity"
"Put this file on the decentralized network"
"Archive this video.mp4"
```

### Command Aliases

The plugin recognizes multiple command variations:

- **Upload**: "upload", "store", "save", "put"
- **Target**: "0G", "Zero Gravity", "decentralized network", "blockchain storage"
- **File types**: Any file extension or "this file", "my document", etc.

## File Upload Examples

### Basic File Upload

```javascript
// User message: "Upload my presentation.pptx"
// Plugin automatically handles the upload process
```

### Multiple File Types

The plugin supports various file formats:

- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WEBP
- **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG
- **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, TAR, GZ
- **Code**: JS, TS, PY, GO, RS, SOL

### File Path Handling

The plugin accepts different path formats:

```text
"Upload ./documents/report.pdf"          # Relative path
"Store /home/user/images/photo.jpg"      # Absolute path
"Save ~/Downloads/file.zip"              # Home directory
"Upload file.txt"                        # Current directory
```

## Response Handling

The plugin provides feedback on upload operations:

### Success Response

```text
✅ Successfully uploaded file.pdf to 0G network
📍 File hash: QmX1Y2Z3...
🔗 Access URL: https://gateway.0g.ai/ipfs/QmX1Y2Z3...
```

### Error Handling

```text
❌ Failed to upload file.pdf
🔍 Reason: File not found at specified path
💡 Tip: Check file path and permissions
```

## Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Access

For advanced use cases, access the plugin's methods directly:

```javascript
import { zgPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-0g";

// Access plugin actions
const uploadAction = zgPlugin.actions.find(action => 
  action.name === "ZG_UPLOAD"
);

// Execute upload programmatically
const result = await uploadAction.handler({
  filePath: "/path/to/file.pdf"
});
```

### Custom File Handling

Implement custom file processing before upload:

```javascript
// Pre-process files before upload
const processAndUpload = async (filePath) => {
  // Custom validation
  if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
    throw new Error("File not found");
  }
  
  // File size check
  const stats = fs.statSync(filePath);
  if (stats.size > 100 * 1024 * 1024) { // 100MB limit
    throw new Error("File too large");
  }
  
  // Proceed with upload
  return await uploadToZG(filePath);
};
```

## Best Practices

### File Organization

- Use descriptive file names
- Organize files in logical directory structures
- Consider file size limitations
- Implement proper error handling

### Security Considerations

- Validate file types before upload
- Scan files for malware if needed
- Implement access controls
- Monitor upload activity

### Performance Optimization

- Compress large files before upload
- Use batch operations for multiple files
- Implement retry logic for failed uploads
- Cache frequently accessed files
