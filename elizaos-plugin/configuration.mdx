# Configuration

The ElizaOS 0G plugin requires several environment variables to connect to the 0G network and perform storage operations.

## Required Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file or deployment environment:

```bash
ZEROG_INDEXER_RPC=<0G indexer RPC endpoint>
ZEROG_EVM_RPC=<0G EVM RPC endpoint>
ZEROG_PRIVATE_KEY=<Private key for transactions>
ZEROG_FLOW_ADDRESS=<0G Flow contract address>
```

### Variable Descriptions

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ZEROG_INDEXER_RPC` | 0G indexer RPC endpoint for querying network state | `https://indexer.0g.ai` |
| `ZEROG_EVM_RPC` | 0G EVM-compatible RPC endpoint for transactions | `https://evmrpc.0g.ai` |
| `ZEROG_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key for signing transactions (keep secure!) | `0x1234...` |
| `ZEROG_FLOW_ADDRESS` | Contract address for 0G Flow operations | `0xabcd...` |

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
Never commit private keys to version control or expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

### Environment Variable Security

- Use secure environment variable management systems
- Rotate private keys periodically
- Ensure RPC endpoints are accessible and trusted
- Verify private key has sufficient permissions for operations

### Production Considerations

- Use separate keys for development and production
- Implement key rotation policies
- Monitor transaction activity
- Set up alerts for unusual activity

## Configuration Validation

The plugin will validate your configuration on startup. Common issues include:

- **Invalid RPC endpoints**: Ensure URLs are accessible
- **Insufficient permissions**: Verify private key has required permissions
- **Network connectivity**: Check firewall and network settings
- **Contract addresses**: Ensure Flow contract address is correct

## Example Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# 0G Network Configuration
ZEROG_INDEXER_RPC=https://indexer-testnet.0g.ai
ZEROG_EVM_RPC=https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai
ZEROG_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
ZEROG_FLOW_ADDRESS=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

## Next Steps

With configuration complete, learn how to [use the plugin](/elizaos-plugin/usage) in your ElizaOS agents.
