# Introduction

Welcome to the 0G AI SDK - a powerful TypeScript SDK for building AI applications with decentralized storage and compute capabilities.

## What is 0G AI SDK?

The 0G AI SDK provides a comprehensive toolkit for developers to build AI-powered applications that leverage:

- **Chat Interface**: Create conversational AI experiences with streaming support
- **Memory System**: Persistent memory storage for AI agents and conversations
- **Agent Framework**: Build autonomous AI agents with tool integration
- **Decentralized Storage**: Store data on the 0G network for permanence and availability
- **Compute Broker**: Access distributed compute resources for AI workloads

## Supported Models

The 0G AI SDK supports state-of-the-art AI models running on the 0G decentralized compute network:

| Model | Provider Address | Description | Verification |
|-------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **llama-3.3-70b-instruct** | `0xf07240Efa67755B5311bc75784a061eDB47165Dd` | State-of-the-art 70B parameter model for general AI tasks | TEE (TeeML) |
| **deepseek-r1-70b** | `0x3feE5a4dd5FDb8a32dDA97Bed899830605dBD9D3` | Advanced reasoning model optimized for complex problem solving | TEE (TeeML) |
